# Event Handlers

A domain event handler is bound to `MsgPhp\Domain\Event\DomainEventHandlerInterface`. Its purpose is to implement the
handling of [domain events](events.md) within a certain context.

Usually an entity implements it in order to mutate its own state (i.e. self-handling). It enforces the entity state to
be valid by design as it encapsulates all write operations.

In practice domain events can be recorded on trigger. It allows to re-play them at any point in time afterwards.
Consider this a design choice to be made upfront, e.g. in case your entity design requires its history to be accessible.

## API

### `handleEvent(DomainEventInterface $event): bool`

Handles the given domain event for a known subject. A boolean return value tells if the domain event is actually handled
yes or no.

## Implementations

### `MsgPhp\Domain\Event\DomainEventHandlerTrait`

A utility trait implementing the event handler API. By convention it maps events to
`handle<Event_Class_Name_Without_Event_Suffix>Event()` methods. It's designed to support default [events](events.md#implementations)
out-of-the-box.

#### Basic example

```php
<?php

use MsgPhp\Domain\Event\{DomainEventHandlerInterface, DomainEventHandlerTrait};

// --- SETUP ---

class MyEvent
{
    public $newValue;
    
    public function __construct($value)
    {
        $this->newValue = $value;
    }
}

class MyEntity implements DomainEventHandlerInterface
{
    use DomainEventHandlerTrait;
    
    public $value;
    
    private function handleMyEvent(MyEvent $event): bool
    {
        if ($this->value === $event->newValue) {
            return false;
        }

        $this->value = $event->newValue;
        
        return true;
    }
    
}

// --- USAGE ---

$entity = new MyEntity();

if ($entity->handleEvent(new MyEvent('new value'))) {
    // do something
}
```
