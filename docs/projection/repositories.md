# Projection Repositories

A projection repository is bound to `MsgPhp\Domain\Projection\ProjectionRepository`. Its purpose is to store and query
projection documents.

## API

### `find(string $type, string $id): ?array`

Finds a single projection document by type and ID. In case the document cannot be found `null` should be returned.

---

### `save(string $type, array $document): void`

Saves a projection document. The document will be available on any subsequent query.

---

### `saveAll(string $type, iterable<int, array> $documents): void`

Saves all projection documents at once. The documents will be available on any subsequent query.

---

### `delete(string $type, string $id): bool`

Deletes a projection document by type and ID. The document will be unavailable on any subsequent query. A boolean return
value indicates the document was actually deleted yes or no.

## Implementations

### `MsgPhp\Domain\Infrastructure\Elasticsearch\ProjectionRepository`

An Elasticsearch tailored projection repository.
