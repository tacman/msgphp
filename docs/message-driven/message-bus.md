# Message Bus

A domain message bus is bound to `MsgPhp\Domain\Message\DomainMessageBus`. Its purpose is to dispatch any type of
message object either synchronously or asynchronously.

A message object is considered [domain-specific language] (DSL) and can be listened for using so called "message
handlers" (a [PHP callable]).

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation

Commands are a specific type of messages, typically used for "commanding" the domain, thus describing actions to be
taken.

Typically commands require exactly one "command handler" listening.

## API

### `dispatch(object $message): void`

Dispatches the given message object.

## Implementations

### `MsgPhp\Domain\Infrastructure\Messenger\DomainMessageBus`

A Symfony Messenger tailored domain message bus.
