# Bundle Installation

The project bundles are tailored to the [Symfony Framework] and designed to be used standalone. Its main purpose is to
enable a specific domain layer within an application.

## Available Bundles

<!--ref-start:available-bundles-->
- `msgphp/eav-bundle`: Basic entity-attribute-value management (the `EAV` domain)
- `msgphp/user-bundle`: Basic user management (the `User` domain)
<!--ref-end:available-bundles-->

## Installation

```bash
composer require msgphp/<name>-bundle
```

!!! info
    When [Symfony Flex] is used to mange your Symfony application the minimal bundle configuration is created for you
    automatically based on [MsgPHP recipes]

## Configuration

A bundle provides the following configuration nodes by default:

### `class_mapping`

Configures the bundle with a class mapping to tell which classes of yours should be used for a known class of ours.

```yaml
msgphp_<name>:
    class_mapping:
        MsgPhp\SomeClass: App\SomeClass
```

The class mapping applies when working with an [object factory](../ddd/factory/object.md).

Depending on the bundle a specific class mapping entry might enable one of the bundle its features which is otherwise
disabled by default.

### `id_type_mapping`

Configures the bundle [domain identifier](../ddd/identifiers.md) types. Each key must be a sub class of
`MsgPhp\Domain\DomainIdInterface` whereas each value must be a known type name.

It ensures a default class mapping entry is added which maps the identifier to a [concrete implementation](../ddd/identifiers.md#implementations).

```yaml
msgphp_<name>:
    id_type_mapping:
        MsgPhp\SomeDomain\SomeIdInterface: some_type_name
```

!!! note
    See the [reference](../reference/identifiers.md) page for all available identifiers provided per domain

By convention any [Doctrine DBAL type] can be used for a type name. Additionally the following UUID types are detected
as well:

- `uuid`
- `uuid_binary`
- `uuid_binary_ordered_time`

### `default_id_type`

Configures a default type name to use for all known domain identifiers provided by the bundle. See also [`id_type_mapping`](#id_type_mapping).

```yaml
msgphp_<name>:
    default_id_type: integer
```

### `commands`

By default a command handler provided by the bundle might be enabled or disabled depending on an [entity feature](../ddd/entities.md#common-entity-features)
is being used yes or no.

However, in case of a [event-sourcing command handler](../message-driven/cqrs.md#event-sourcing-command-handler)
the corresponding [domain event](../event-sourcing/events.md) might be supported regardless. Depending on your own
[event handler](../event-sourcing/event-handlers.md) implementation. To keep leveraging default command handlers they
can be explicitly enabled or disabled by command.

```yaml
msgphp_<name>:
    commands:
        MsgPhp\SomeDomain\Command\SomeCommand: true
        MsgPhp\SomeDomain\Command\SomeOtherCommand: false
```

## Basic Configuration Example

Given a bundle provides the following domain identifiers:

- `MsgPhp\SomeDomain\FooIdInterface`
- `MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BarIdInterface`
- `MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BazIdInterface`

```yaml
msgphp_<name>:
    default_id_type: uuid
    id_type_mapping:
        MsgPhp\SomeDomain\FooIdInterface: integer
        # implied:
        # MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BarIdInterface: uuid
        # MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BazIdInterface: uuid
    class_mapping:
        MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BarIdInterface: App\MyBarUuid
        # implied:
        # MsgPhp\SomeDomain\FooIdInterface: MsgPhp\SomeDomain\FooId
        # MsgPhp\SomeDomain\BazIdInterface: MsgPhp\SomeDomain\Infra\Uuid\BazId
```
